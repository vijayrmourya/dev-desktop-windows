# üåê AWS Windows EC2 Remote Development Environment

This project automates the creation of a **Windows-based remote development environment** on AWS using an EC2 instance. It follows **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** principles to provision the instance, dynamically configure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access based on your local IP, and manage the instance's password securely.

With this setup, you can easily deploy a secure Windows EC2 instance accessible from your local machine, enabling a scalable, cloud-based development workspace.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dynamic Password Generation for RDP Access**: Automatically restricts RDP access to your EC2 instance based on your local IP and securely generates the Windows Administrator password for remote login.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**: Fully automated infrastructure management using Terraform, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.
- **Simple Teardown**: Easily clean up and remove resources once you're done, preventing unnecessary costs and maintaining a clean environment.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you clone the required **base Terraform module repository** that contains the essential infrastructure components.

1. Clone the base module repository here:

   [Terraform Modules Repository](https://github.com/vijayrmourya/terraform-modules)

2. Ensure your directory structure looks like this:

   ```bash
   |-parent-folder
      |- dev-desktop-setup
      |- terraform-module
   ```

### üöÄ Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy the Windows EC2 instance:

1. **Clone this repository** (`dev-desktop-setup`) into your local environment.

2. **Run the `deploy.sh` script** to provision the EC2 instance:

   ```bash
   source deploy.sh
   ```

   - This script will handle Terraform initialization, apply the infrastructure, and configure RDP access based on your local IP.

3. **Retrieve the Windows Administrator password** generated by Terraform. You can obtain the password by running the following command after deployment:

   ```bash
   terraform output windows-password
   ```

4. **Connect to your Windows EC2 instance** via RDP using the IP address of the instance and the password retrieved in step 3.

### üßπ Cleaning Up the Environment

When you're done with the EC2 instance, easily tear down the infrastructure to avoid unnecessary charges. Simply run the `cleanup.sh` script:

```bash
source cleanup.sh
```

This script will safely terminate and remove all provisioned AWS resources, ensuring no unnecessary costs.

---

### üìÇ Project Structure

- **`deploy.sh`**: Automates the deployment of the EC2 instance and all related resources.
- **`cleanup.sh`**: Safely destroys all created infrastructure, releasing any AWS resources.
- **`terraform-module`**: Contains the essential Terraform module used to create the EC2 instance and manage infrastructure.

---

### ‚ö° Quick Recap

1. Clone the base module repository.
2. Run `deploy.sh` to provision the Windows EC2 instance.
3. Retrieve the Windows Administrator password using `terraform output`.
4. Connect to your remote development environment via RDP.
5. Run `cleanup.sh` to tear down and remove the resources when done.

### üìù Important Notes

- Ensure that your local environment has the correct AWS credentials and permissions to manage resources in your AWS account.
- The term "local environment" refers to the system where you execute this infrastructure-as-code solution.
- Be sure to use a Windows Remote Desktop client (RDP) to connect to your Windows EC2 instance.
